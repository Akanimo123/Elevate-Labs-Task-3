# Elevate-Labs-Task-3

The objective of this particular task was to use SQL queries to analyze data and extract insights from it. To achieve this objective, I created a table myself on MYSQL Workbench 8.0 CE which you would see in the Table creation screenshot. This table itself contained product details and I made sure to assign appropriate data types and primary key to the neccesary data field. The sql file elevate labs.sql is located in the expense_tracker schema. All other queries executed can be seen in the screenshots found in this repository and also on the file elevate labs.sql
